# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

## Problem Description

In this competition, we are tasked with building a deep learning model to predict which tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. This is a binary classification problem using text data.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of two files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The `train.csv` file contains tweets along with labels indicating whether the tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0). The `test.csv` file contains tweets for which we need to predict the labels.

## Objective

The goal is to build a robust model that can accurately classify disaster-related tweets.
